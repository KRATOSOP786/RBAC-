API Endpoints: Secure APIs for registration, login, profile management, and access control.
Role-Specific Navigation: Frontend UI dynamically adjusts navbar components and colors based on user role.
#Technologies Used
Backend: Node.js, Express.js
Database: MongoDB (for storing user roles and data)
Frontend: React.js (for dynamic navbar and user interface)
Authentication: JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure session management
Authorization: Role-based access control system
